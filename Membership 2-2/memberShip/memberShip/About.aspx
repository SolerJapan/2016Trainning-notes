 <h2>
        My Personal Statement
    </h2>
    <p>
         Through beads of sweat I can finally see the finish line. Propelled forward by 
        my loaded legs, my heart pumping loud inside, along the racing track am I 
        struggling to make a last dashing effort. The 10,000-meter race is exhausting. 
        Other contestants are right behind me; they are looking for chances to overtake 
        me. I cannot afford to let off, not even a slightest bit because I have been 
        preparing for this moment for years. “Beat them! You Must!” a voice deep inside 
        me keeps shouting to me. In a match, there is just one aim—to win and to get the 
        upper hand of your opponents. To do so, it is even necessary to go beyond one’s 
        ultimate limit. Then the crucial moment comes, the moment of fulfilling one’s 
        prescribed objective. I am by no means the smartest student in my class. But my 
        perseverance, my pursuit of excellence, and my readiness to challenge my 
        ultimate limit have enabled me to achieve self-transcendence time and again in 
        my past education. Whether in winning prizes during major academic aptitudes 
        contests through my middle school days or in entering the Mathematics Department 
        of XX University (arguably the best place to study mathematics in China) waived 
        of the otherwise required entrance examinations, I have achieved every success 
        through strong willpower and persistence. I believe that life is a long journey 
        and my present application for XX University, arguably the best university in 
        the world, is my new attempt to scale new heights. In the summer of 2002, 
        several major universities in China, including XX University and XX University, 
        offered to enroll me free of entrance examinations due to my winning the first 
        prize in the XXX that year. I eventually chose XX University. In its Mathematics 
        Department are gathered the most outstanding talents of the country. In this 
        competitive environment, my aptitudes not only in mathematics but also in 
        physics and computer have improved rapidly. I realized that I had to compete in 
        order to excel. I achieved all-round academic development at XX University. 
        Apart from receiving effective and systematic training in mathematics, I have 
        had ample opportunities to exchange with the first-rate professors and fellow 
        students. Under the influence of the University’s overall academic atmosphere, I 
        have attained increasing mental maturity by developing my team spirit, personal 
        responsibility, and other personal qualities. For the first time in my life I 
        gained the understanding that a true elite is born out of a group of elites. 
        Although I do not pretend to be the best student in my department, every major 
        progress that I have achieved in this unique university has repeatedly convinced 
        me that, as long as I persevere academically the way that I persevere 
        athletically, I will ultimately develop myself into a person of outstanding 
        excellence of my generation. My choice of switching to an undergraduate program 
        in Finance at XX University originates from my ideal of receiving the world’s 
        first-rate undergraduate education and of exposing myself to the influence of an 
        elitist academic culture. Just as XX University has attracted to it the best 
        students in China, XX University has attracted to it the best students in the 
        world. I identify myself strongly with your university motto which admonishes 
        your students to be with the greatest masters of the academia and, most 
        importantly, to be with the truth. At such a world prestigious university as XX 
        University, it will be possible for me to listen to the instructions of the 
        world ‘s best teachers, to exchange with and to compete against the best 
        students in the world. Those two factors will give me lifelong benefits. I 
        believe that only by plunging myself into this highly competitive environment 
        will it be possible for me to bring my important potential into the fullest 
        play, and to further develop my courage to face challenges, enhance my 
        endurance, and improve my analytical thinking. The motivation behind my decision 
        to specialize in finance lies in my determination to apply my special aptitudes 
        in mathematics to the study of social science. China is currently experiencing 
        an unprecedented economic development in history. As a student that has grown up 
        in pace with China’s implementation of market economy, I have the strong wish to 
        learn the most advanced knowledge and skills in the world and to contribute my 
        efforts to the further development of China’s economy. Like many other elitist 
        students of XX University, I find my middle school education filled with 
        accolades won through hard efforts and toils. From junior middle school to 
        senior middle school (XX Middle School, the key middle school of XX Province), I 
        maintained a top 1% academic performance in my grade (consisting of 400 
        students) and was given, among various awards, the Outstanding Student honor 
        every year. I received approximately 20 awards in national and provincial 
        contests of mathematics, physics, English and chemistry (please refer to my 
        Resume for more detailed information). Among those awards, some of the most 
        important ones include the first prize in the XX, the gold medal in the “Hope 
        Cup” XX, the third prize in the XX, and the first prize in the XX City’s XX. I 
        have strong interest and special aptitudes in mathematics and physics. By 
        studying those two subjects, I have not only improved my scholastic level and 
        rigorous logical reasoning but also developed my ability to solve problems 
        independently. Although my future career will not necessarily be in the field of 
        mathematics, I firmly believe that mathematics is the most fundamental science 
        through which human beings gain knowledge about this world. The knowledge and 
        the way of thinking that I have developed through my study of mathematics, 
        together with the strong willpower that I have evolved in the process, will be 
        my lifelong assets. Nevertheless, I have never allowed myself to be a bookworm. 
        Instead, I have always sought for comprehensive personal development in 
        management skills, interpersonal communication, and in athletic contests. During 
        my senior middle school days, I was a student official in the Students Union and 
        was responsible for organizing many important campus events such as the choral 
        festival, cultural festival, debate contests, and exchanges with other schools 
        in the city. I was the editor of the student publication “Footprint”. Although 
        my coursework at XX University is very heavy, I have been working as a key 
        student official of the departmental Students Union. While enriching my 
        extracurricular life, my work at the Students Union has shown me the importance 
        of teamwork and has taught me important skills of sound interpersonal relations. 
        The development of organizational and management skills will also become an 
        important legacy for my future financial study and practice. For a dedicated 
        runner, he has only one focus — to dash to the finish line ahead of his 
        adversaries. It is a test of his stamina and he must prove his sportsmanship. 
        For me, the sole reason for pursuing a more advanced education is that I have 
        come to the moment of facing a new challenge and I need to conquer it. The 
        height of life is reached through repeated self-transcendences—this is what I 
        understand about the meaning of life. I have done so in the past and I will 
        continue to do so in the future. What I am doing at present is one of those 
        self-transcendences—to apply for admission into a university of true world 
        prestige. For many years, I have been practicing 10,000-meter long-distance 
        running everyday. In so doing, I have not only developed my strong physique but 
        also won a spate of prizes at sports meetings. The most important thing is that 
        I have improved my character and strengthened my willpower. In every 
        10,000-meter event, I clench my teeth, try to go beyond my ultimate limit and 
        beat my competitors, until I dash to the finish ahead of others. Each experience 
        is an experience of setting and fulfilling an objective.
