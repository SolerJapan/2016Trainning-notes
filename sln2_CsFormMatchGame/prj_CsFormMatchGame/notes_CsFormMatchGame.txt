create new windows forms project
  project  name = prj_CsFormMatchGame
  solution name = sln_CsFormMatchGame

in Solution Explorer, rename file Form1.cs to tFormMatchGame.cs

set the form properties
  Name          = tFormMatchGame
  Text          = "Match Game"
  Size          = 550 x 550
  StartPosition = CenterScreen

add to the form a TableLayoutPanel
  Name            = oTblLayPanel
  Dock            = Fill
  BackColor       = CornflowerBlue  (a Web color)
  CellBorderStyle = Inset

show tablelayoutpanel tasks popup
  Edit Rows and Cols
  add 2 cols to make 4 cols total
  set all cols to 25%
  add 2 rows to make 4 rows total
  set all rows to 25%

add to the 1st cell a label control
  Name                       = oLab1
  BackColor                  = CornflowerBlue
  AutoSize                   = False
  Dock                       = Fill
  TextAlign                  = MiddleCenter
  FontName                   = Webdings  (click ... to use FontDialog)
  FontStyle                  = Bold
  FontSize                   = 36
  Text                       = "c"     (box symbol)
  UseMnemonic                = False
  UseCompatibleTextRendering = True

copy the label and paste it into the remaining cells
rename the labels as oLab1 (1st cell) to oLab16 (last cell)

in the code file, add to the form, 2 fields for a Random obj and a List obj

write a utility method called InitList() to populate the list obj with 8 pairs of symbols

write a utility method called InitCells() to give each cell a randomly chosen item from the list obj, and hide all the cell labels text

write a utility method called CheckWinner() to check if the user has won (all the cell labels are unhidden)

dclick the form's titlebar to generate the load event handler
in the handler, initialize the random obj, list obj, and cells

build and run

add 2 fields to store references to the 2 clicked labels

add to the form a Timer component
  Name     = oTimer
  Interval = 1000

in the form's tray, dclick the timer component to generate its tick event handler
in the handler, stop the timer, and hide the text of the 2 clicked labels

dclick the 1st cell's label to generate its click event handler
select all the remaining cell labels and assign them the same click event handler
add code to the event handler to unhide up to 2 clicked cells and hide them after 1 sec if they don't match
