    <p style="background-color: #FFFFFF">

         Through beads of sweat I can finally see the finish line. Propelled forward by

        my loaded legs, my heart pumping loud inside, along the racing track am I

        struggling to make a last dashing effort. The 10,000-meter race is exhausting.

        Other contestants are right behind me; they are looking for chances to overtake

        me. I cannot afford to let off, not even a slightest bit because I have been

        preparing for this moment for years. “Beat them! You Must!” a voice deep inside

        me keeps shouting to me. In a match, there is just one aim—to win and to get the

        upper hand of your opponents. To do so, it is even necessary to go beyond one’s

        ultimate limit. Then the crucial moment comes, the moment of fulfilling one’s

        prescribed objective. I am by no means the smartest student in my class. But my

        perseverance, my pursuit of excellence, and my readiness to challenge my

        ultimate limit have enabled me to achieve self-transcendence time and again in

        my past education. Whether in winning prizes during major academic aptitudes

        contests through my middle school days or in entering the Mathematics Department

        of XX University (arguably the best place to study mathematics in China) waived

        of the otherwise required entrance examinations, I have achieved every success

        through strong willpower and persistence. I believe that life is a long journey

        and my present application for XX University, arguably the best university in

        the world, is my new attempt to scale new heights. The

        height of life is reached through repeated self-transcendences—this is what I

        understand about the meaning of life. I have done so in the past and I will

        continue to do so in the future. What I am doing at present is one of those

        self-transcendences—to apply for admission into a university of true world

        prestige. For many years, I have been practicing 10,000-meter long-distance

        running everyday. In so doing, I have not only developed my strong physique but

        also won a spate of prizes at sports meetings. The most important thing is that

        I have improved my character and strengthened my willpower. In every

        10,000-meter event, I clench my teeth, try to go beyond my ultimate limit and

        beat my competitors, until I dash to the finish ahead of others. Each experience

        is an experience of setting and fulfilling an objective.
